This is almost entirely taken from here:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Create-a-Simple-Python-Text-Editor/

I wanted to play with TKinter and the make a simple text editor just to see
how it works. I used the above instructable to do so. This is just a log of
the code so I can find it later.

My only real changes were to make it work with the Python3 version of TKinter and to fix a few bugs in the save dialog.
